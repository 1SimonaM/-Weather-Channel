# 365-Weather-Forecast

This project is about building a browser-based weather dashboard that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the 5-day weather forecast for cities. The dashboard is dynamically updated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To use the API, developers need to apply for an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once they have the API key, they can make URL queries with specific parameters to access weather data. The base URL format for querying the 5-day weather forecast is: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

The project also used LocalStorage to store any persistent data. Developers will need to create a variable to store the API key and construct the query URL using string concatenation. They can then use the Fetch API to make the API call and retrieve weather data based on user input.
